This repository implements the early fault detection algorithm for lithium-ion battery packs described in the paper: "An early fault detection method of series battery packs based on multi-feature clustering and unsupervised scoring" by Wenhao Nie, Zhongwei Deng, et al.

## Overview

This project presents a novel approach for early detection of lithium-ion battery faults in electric vehicles (EVs), addressing a critical safety challenge in the rapidly growing EV market. Using cloud-based battery data, our method employs multi-feature clustering and unsupervised scoring to detect potential faults significantly earlier than traditional Battery Management Systems (BMS).

### Key Features

- **Multi-feature extraction** to characterize battery faults from various perspectives
- **Unsupervised clustering** for real-time anomaly detection without labeled training data
- **Hierarchical warning strategy** to minimize false alarms while providing early detection
- **Validated on real-world EV data** with over 10 days advance warning compared to BMS

## Method

Our algorithm consists of four main components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare cloud-based battery data
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract three key features from battery voltage data:
   - Shannon entropy
   - Cell state value (based on State Representation Methodology)
   - Extended RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
3. **Unsupervised Scoring**: 
   - Feature normalization
   - DBSCAN clustering to identify outliers
   - Sliding window technique for iterative scoring
4. **Hierarchical Warning**: Two-level warning strategy using thresholds and cumulative sum

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the required packages:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BatICM/unsupervised-battery-faults.git
cd unsupervised-battery-faults

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

```python
from src import battery_fault_detection

# Load and preprocess your data
data = battery_fault_detection.load_data("path/to/your/data.csv")
preprocessed_data = battery_fault_detection.preprocess_data(data)

# Run the detection algorithm
results = battery_fault_detection.detect_faults(
    preprocessed_data,
    eps=0.6,                   # DBSCAN epsilon parameter
    min_pts=3,                 # DBSCAN MinPts parameter
    threshold_1=0.5,           # First-level warning threshold
    threshold_2=100,           # Second-level warning threshold
    window_length="auto"       # Auto-select window length based on cell count
)

# View detection results
print(results.summary())
battery_fault_detection.visualize_results(results)
```

### Example Notebook

See the `notebooks/demo.ipynb` for a complete example of using the algorithm on sample data.

## Parameters

The algorithm uses the following key parameters:

- **DBSCAN parameters**:
  - `eps` (default: 0.6): The maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered as part of the same neighborhood
  - `min_pts` (default: 3): Minimum number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered a core point

- **Hierarchical warning thresholds**:
  - `threshold_1` (default: 0.5): First-level warning threshold for unsupervised scores
  - `threshold_2` (default: 100): Second-level warning threshold for cumulative sum values

- **Window length**:
  - `window_length` (default: "auto"): Length of sliding window for iterative scoring (defaults to number of cells in the battery pack)

## Results

When tested on data from three different vehicles with battery faults, our method:

1. Successfully detected all faulty cells with 100% accuracy (compared to 50-75% for single-feature methods)
2. Produced zero false alarms (compared to 2500-8000+ for single-feature methods)
3. Provided warnings over 10 days earlier than traditional BMS alerts
